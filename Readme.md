## Facebook Bot in python

This is a project I created using my other library - "Facebook_Pybot".

This script will run a bot which can

    1. Do basic conversation via Api.ai (now diagflow)
    2. Provides user with nearby places info using Foursquare API when a location is sent to it.
    3. Using user search terms provide gifs to the user by querying Giphy API
    4. Give weather forecast.
    5. Provide rail enquiry which includes trains running on any day, seat availability.


**Requirements** - Python 3.6+
